    "# Introduction to Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is a way to package apps, and all of their dependencies, into **images** that can be easily loaded onto any operating system and executed (\"instantiated\") as a **container**\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker containers are like a virtual machine (like the one you are using to take this course), but they are much much smaller because the image used to instantiate a container doesn't contain an operating system.  A container contains only the app, and the other things the app needs to run - all other functionality comes from the host operating system.  Apps are \"installed\" and configured inside of the container so that the user doesn't need to go through the installation or configuration process - the app \"just works\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As data scientists, you are going to create a lot of software in your lives!  Docker (and other associated projects) is a good option for making your software available for others to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introductory course, we will only learn how to USE Docker images/containers, we will not learn how to CREATE them (this may be added to the Bioinformatics Programming Challenges course this year!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Surf to:  https://hub.docker.com/explore/\n",
    "\n",
    "This page lets you browse or search for images that have apps you want.  For example, if you wanted to write some code in Python, but didn't have Python installed, you could download the Python docker image (search for it).  Similarly, if you wanted to run the BLAST Nucleotide/amino acid sequence search program, you could use it's Docker distribution instead of installing it (search for Blast.... search for \"bioinformatics\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is, itself, an app, so it must be installed.  **I have done this for you already**, but here are some recent instructions for how to install it on Linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### get the keys to validate the docker repository\n",
    "\n",
    "    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 \\\n",
    "      --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Add the official docker repository to your apt\n",
    " \n",
    "    sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-xenial main'\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Update \n",
    " \n",
    "    sudo apt update\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install some Docker dependencies\n",
    " \n",
    "    sudo apt install linux-image-generic linux-image-extra-virtual\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Reboot\n",
    " \n",
    "    sudo reboot\n",
    " \n",
    "    sudo apt install docker-engine\n",
    " \n",
    "#### add your user id to the docker group so that permissions are not a problem\n",
    "\n",
    "    sudo usermod -a -G docker osboxes\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Docker Images\n",
    "\n",
    "To \"get\" an image, the easiest thing to do is to \"pull\" it.  **pull** will only download the Image to your system, it will not run it (i.e. it will not instantiate it into a Container).  The **pull** step **is not strictly necessary** - the **docker run** command (below) will also do a **pull** before it attempts to run the Image; however, if you wanted to use an existing Image as the base for creating your own software app and your own Docker Image, you might want to **pull** it without running it.\n",

    "## Running more complex software\n",
    "\n",
    "hello-world is not very complex :-)  Docker containers can contain many kinds of functionalities, from web servers to databases to entire operating systems.  Often you will need to configure the app(s) inside of the Container, or give the Container access to certain folders on your computer, or open certain ports into the Container (e.g. so that the world can access your Web server)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved using **docker run**, with additional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "for example, to \"map\" a communication port from the host computer to the Container (e.g. port 80 is the normal port for a Web server), you would add:\n",
    "\n",
    "     -p 80:80    # this means, the host port 80 goes to the Container port 80\n",
    "     \n",

    "     -e MY_VARIABLE_HERE=some_value\n",

    "Every Image will have different instructions about how to run it, [so I wont (can't!) explain all of the options here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#options).  Just read the instructions for the Image you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last argument we will learn is \"--name\".  This is used to give a specific (memorable) name to your Container.  Moreover, it allows you to use the same Image, with different configurations, in different Containers (e.g. you run the **same Web Server Image twice**, one Container runs your Personal Website (--name my-personal-website) and the other one runs your Laboratory Website (--name lab-web-server).  The two Containers can run at the same time! \n",
